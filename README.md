=======================

Where do I get the Crack-The-Coding-Interview book online?

[CrackTheCodingInterview][1]

> Chapter 1: **Arrays and String**, 8 subjects, which begins _1._, same are the next chapters.

> Chapter 2: **Linked lists**

> Chapter 3: **Stacks and Queues**

> Chapter 4: **Trees and Graphs**

> Chapter 5: **Bit Manipulation**

> Chapter 6: **Brain Teasers**

> Chapter 7: **Mathematics and Probability**

#### Key in resume:

- _`Are you smart?`_
- _`Can you code?`_

Limit the content to the best, most impressive, most relevant items.

Accomplished X by implementing Y which led to Z.

Try to make the results "measurable" somehow.

Projects,(whether it is academic project, course project) what it is, language, individual or a team project.

Course Projects / Independent Projects

- Try to solve the problem on your own.
- Write the code for the algorithm on paper.
- Type your paper code as-is into a computer.
- Do a mock interview.(CareerCup)

#### A "must known" list:
| Data Structures     | Algorithm            | Concepts                |
| :------------------ | ---------------------| ------------------------|
| Linked Lists        | BFS                  | Bit Manipulation        |
| Binary Trees        | DFS                  | Singleton Design Pattern|
| Tries               | Binary Search        | Factory Design Pattern  |
| Stacks              | Merge Sort           | Memory(Stack vs Heap)   |
| Queues              | Quick Sort           | Recursion               |
| Vector / ArrayLists | Tree Insert/Find/etc | Big-O Time              |
| Hash Tables         |                      |                         |

Be Specific, Not Arrogant.

Structure the responses using S.A.R. : Situation, Action, Response.

So when you get a hard question, don't panic. Just start talking aloud about how you would solve it.

- Ask your interviewer questions to resolve ambiguity.

- Design an Algorithm.

- Write pseudo-code first, but make sure to tell your interviewer that you're writing pseudo-code.

- Write your code, not too slow and not too fast.

- Test your code and carefully fix any mistakes.

## Besides, I would represent some my own experience later
